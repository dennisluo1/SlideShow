		<h2>Your donation to the Global Educational Exchange supports foreign volunteers who participate in teaching a foreign language in American classrooms. In the long run, students leave with a impactful foreign language class and volunteers leave with a time well spent learning about a culture other than their own. We see this as a mutual benefit that begins with your helping hand.</h2> 
		<h1>How Your Donation Helps:</h1>
		<h2>
			<ul>Allows students to interact with foreign language volunteers</ul>
			<ul>Build strong relationships amongst individuals from around the world and eventually create stronger ties amongst nations around the world</ul>
			<ul>Increase fluency amongst students taking foreign-language classes in inner-city schools</ul>
